  - <&9>The Novice Guide to Alchemical Transactions
  - To my Pupil, this novel will attempt to bridge highly abstract, complicated concepts to your common method of thinking. The processes, while abstract, should begin to seem like common sense as your alchemical brain begins to develop.
  - <&9>Chapter One <n>Foundations of Alchemy
  - Alchemy, as defined, is the process of utilizing the core elements in order to complete complex magical processes. These processes could be as simple as growing a blade of grass more rapidly to bringing a dead rat back from the great beyond.
  - In this land of LaOn, the natives are in posession of large, organic crystals. They call them Stacheia Crystals after their four major gods, the Stacheia. These crystals are known to posess elemental properties equivalent to those of
  - their corresponding god, ie, a piece of the Stacheia Ignos Crystal will have strong heat and fire-like properties. As such, these Stacheia Crystals, or more simply, Elemental Crystals, will be the foundation for our dabblings. 
  - There currently exist four elemental crystals, <n>Crystal of Fire<n>Crystal of Water<n>Crystal of Air<n>Crystal of Earth
  - These crystals cannot be grown, however they are extremely common out in the mainland. Natives seem to collect these almost like colonial currency. Careful eyes are sure to find some out in the world.
  - In a vast percentage of the time spent dabbling, these crystals will be your first ingredient. There is a foolproof process which can allow one to successfully transmute, and the process is as follows.
  - Crystal becomes Dust, Dust becomes Powder. Powders become Stones, Stones and Powders become Omens. Omens transmute all previous ingredients, and omens with omens create Greater Alchemy. 
  - This tome, for your practical uses, will only cover Lesser Alchemy, up to but not including Greater Omens. 
  - <&9>Chapter Two <n>Powders and Stones
  - Your first, basic process, is to crush your newfound Crystal. (Crafting table) <n>Placing your crystal inside of your workbench and crushing it will grant you your first creation, an elemental dust.
  - Elemental dusts do not have as much use as say a powder, which requires a more refined texture. You can do this by smelting your dust. However, you are no measly smith, and as such, you smelt by fusing coal with your ingredient of choice. 
  - Coal and an Elemental Dust will form an Elemental Powder, which will serve as a basis for the majority of your more advanced dabblings. A direct conversion from Elemental Dust to powder grants you a Tier 1, Pure, Elemental Powder. 
  - Powders, due to their unique fusion properties, are able to be mixed together and combined in a simple mortar and pestle. (Crafting Table) By combining pure powders, you are able to create Tier 2 powders, which posses unique effects.
  - For example, fusing pure Fire Powder and pure Water Powder will grant the student a sample of Steam Powder, which can be used in extracting gases.
  - All tier two powders have a property which allows them to be transmuted into a more tangible, crystalline form. By performing an alchemical smelt on the powder, you can generate the corresponding stone.
  - Stones, unlike common gems, preserve their individual properties even in stone form. For example, Stones of Gravity are commonly found floating in the air or rolling on the ceiling. Stones are also easier to transport and can be used
  - more efficiently in alchemical tools and relics.
  - <&9>Chapter Three <n>Further Notes and Extra Recipes
  - A true alchemist is frequently called a dabbler because they must experiment personally in order to achieve new elements and ingredients. This is why this introductory tome does not list examples or known recipes.
  - As you attempt to mix your ingredients you will eventually fail, losing ingredients and creating nothing. However, you also risk discovering something brand new which hasn't been discovered yet. There are other tomes which detail more
  - accurate and more detailed information, including but not limited to concepts of Greater Alchemy. 
  - "A couple nontraditional recipes. <n>Language Powder: Air Powder, Water Powder, and World Powder. Dilute this powder with water to form a Language Potion."
  - "Separation Powder: Unity Powder merged with a Corruption Shard. Currently, the only source of Corruption Shards are the humanoid Symfora forms found near wells."
  - "Unity Elixir: Unity Powder diluted via water. <n>State Stone: Unity Elixir, with each corner consisting of Separation Powder."
  - "<&9>Final Note: State Stones are categorized under Stones, but act like Omens. Perhaps... if you used a State Stone on this Tome..."

  - <&9>The Advanced Guide to Alchemical Transactions
  - Dear Pupil, if you have not mastered the details of the previous Tome, A Novice Guide to Alchemical Transactions, then it would be wise to go back and practice, for this tome will build off those concepts and principles.
  - <&9>Chapter One <n>Advanced Stones and Materials
  - As a master of Stones, Powders, and Dusts, the student will be able to dabble in true manipulations of those ingredients. However, it is wise to become proficient in more advanced stones, as they have more potent properties.
  - All alchemical transactions and transmutations require energy to execute. While you have accomplished this through manual energy, such as smelting and crushing, this energy will not be applicable to larger scaled projects.
  - Large energy requirements are only feasibly met through the use of Soulstones. Soulstones are utility devices which can contain a great deal of energy. They do not necessarily have to contain a stone, however that is their most
  - practical use. Many alchemists avoid the moral gray area of taking souls by creating elaborate energy stations, working with colonist machinery to convert mechanical energy into usable Soul energy. 
  - Charging a stone can take some time, however it is the best course of action to take. Souls of plants will fill a stone, while Souls of Animals can fill many, while Souls of Fellow Man are unbound. For your purposes, man-farmed
  - energy will be more than adequate. 
  - The SoulStone resevoir is created through combining a Ki Stone - a stone of pure magical native energy, with a Unity Crystal. With nothing to bind the Ki Stone to via Unity, the stone will hold pure Ki Energy instead. 
  - Now, Ki Stones are very similar to Soulstone resevoirs in that they contain energy, however Ki Stones can only contain energy, not souls. Ki Stones can be created by funneling your own energy into a bottle.
  - Fusing your new Ki Stone to an empty Soulstone resevoir will attempt to fill the resevoir. It may take several stones to achieve "Full" status, however it binds the pupil to their work, and is priceless.
  - ((OOC Note: The alchemy class contains a skill which gives you a Ki Stone. Craft an empty SoulStone by combining a Ki Stone and a Unity Crystal. Adding Ki Stones to a SoulStone via crafting will increase the energy in the SoulStone.))
  - By now, using this technique, you should now have achieved the creation of a Full Soul Stone. By placing this into the center of your workspace and placing Separation powder in each corner, you can create an unstable stone
  - referred to as an Anti Stone. The anti stone is categorized as a stone, but acts like an omen in that it contains reversal properties. As such, it will be important in your creations later.
  - <&9>Chapter Two  <n>Omens and Beyond
  - The final method which will become essential in your dabbling is the understanding of Omens. Omens are materials which serve as a transit to enforce specific events on an Element. Ie - you can use an Omen to simulate an event, such
  - as burning, transmuting, breaking, evaporation, and more. You are to use these Omens in conjunction with existing materials to create new combinations.
  - The first tier of Omens consists of the States of Change. This includes Sun, Moon, Cloud, and Star. Combine your State Stone with various elemental crystals to create these.
  - The second tier of Omens consists of the States of Affliction. These are abstracted versions of the States of Change, including Sol, Luna, Darkness, and light. Experiment to discover these recipes.
  - The third tier of Omens consists of the Advanced Omens, the States of Abstraction. These consist of Nature, Existence, Fate, Time, and Universe. Experiment to discover these.
  - This now concludes your basic and advanced training of Alchemy. While more information, including legends of the Philosopher's Stone, is available to those particularly adept at the basics, it has such strong implications if used
  - improperly that it has been locked away in the depths of the Arcanist Guild. 
  - Take care with your work, and operate in the name of science, not selfish desire.

  - The Survival Manual
  - I have many tips for you, my son. However, you must look beyond yourself to appreciate them.
  - Rule 1.) Never run into a situation without thinking. Traps lie everywhere. If you must go, go second, but not last. 
  - Rule 2.) If you aren't sure what it is, you're better off not touching it. Odds are, there's clues about it around you. Use them.
  - Rule 3.) If it looks cute, it'll probably murder you without a second thought.
  - Rule 4.) Treasures are worth a great deal, but selling them risks you losing a greater score.
  - Rule 5.) Always have a catchline. It's quick, snappy, and it makes people look up to you.
  - Rule 6.) Come prepared. Bring water, rations, armor, or whatever you'll need for your venture. 
  - Rule 7.) Friends are always good, but not when you don't want to share.
  - Rule 8.) Finally, use some common sense in your work. You'll get nowhere dying in your first expedition.

  - Firstly, if yar a fisherman, et means yuh can fish up a great deal moar than most of them normal folk. When you fish, ya got tha hart of the sea in ye, so the rare fish, the kind that don' come out, will come to ye.
  - Secondly, there's a couple o' recipes ye ought to learn in order to make yerself viable. You likely ain' gonna get much for yer fish, but the engies luv ye. 
  - Rigging: Made a fortune off this puppy. First off, get yerself some Rope from a farmer. Then, find yerself an iron ingot. Surround that iron with the rope, and ye'll have yerself that riggin.
  - Canvas Patch: Errybody loves them some sea, and sailcloths are yer ticket to it, buh first ya need yer patch. Git yerself some regular ol' string, then surround a rope wif it. Weave it together, and you'll have yerself a patch.
  - Sailcloth: So, if ye got yerself yer patches, then all ye need to do is put down yer rope dead center, then surround em wif the patches. Stitch and tie, and ye got a sailcloth.  
  - Lastly, ya smell like fish. Throw that stench o fish at sombody and make em regret comin near ye.

  - The Blacksmithing Manual
  - Now listen up, cuz you've got a good deal aheaddya. Smithin' ain't no joke, and there's a lot to it. But first, lemme give you a couple pointers.
  - First, you gotta respect your fellow miners and your engies. Them miners, they find all the fancy ores that you'll want for your fancy gear. With it, you'll be set for life. Engies also need you for some of their gear, so be nice to your customers.
  - Secondly, not all ores are created alike, you hear? You might be seeing some darksteel and getting all excited, but it ain't shit compared to that native mithril. If you've got an ore you don't recognize,
  - find yourself a miner and have em look at it. They can tell you what it is you've got. But enough of that, you want to craft shit. 
  - As a smithy, you can craft any iron gear. Any of it. But, not all gear is created alike. Iron goes for a high price, so you can charge a shit-ton. As such, it takes a bit more effort to make it.
  - All iron gear requires what I call a smithin' gem. You make it by puttin diamonds in the corners, then a block o iron in the center. Once you got that, you can put it in your bench with your regular recipes to make your iron gear. Always center slot, cept 
  - for chestplates. Put em top center. For them swords? Just throw the gem in anywhere in with yer regular crafting shape.
  - And that's about it, mate. Sell your stuff for more than it cost ya, and make a hefty profit.

  - <&b>The Tinkerer's Tome
  - There's a great deal of knowledge that I could attempt to pass down to you, for my many years of exploration and tinkering have lead to great wonders.
  - However, I fear that too much information at one time could, by happenstance, liquify your brain. As such, I will explain some basic contraptions at your disposal.
  - 1.) Crossbow - A simple contraption with practical purposes. Top-Center: a bow of your choice, Top left and top right, sticks, center center, a mechanism, and then finally, bottom center, one more stick. 
  - 2.) The Mechanism - Any tinkerer should be able to utilize their tools to create simplistic mechanisms. Do this by fusing three gold nuggets (top row) and one iron one (center center).
  - 3.) Bolts - material for your said crossbow to fire. Somewhat important, eh? Just put a sticks in with an arrow, and you'll be dandy.
  - 4.) Cartridge - any good gunslinger requires their guns, and their guns need cartridges to let em fly. Craft these with an explosive powder, 2 paper, and a piece of gunpowder.   
  - 5.) Ammunition - your bullets, mate. Craft with one iron nugget, one gold nugget, and one gunpowder, and a cartridge. 
  - 6.) Explosive Powder - it's a volatile version of traditional gunpowder. Make it with one gunpowder and one redstone.
  - 7.) Ramrod - Not required, but nice to have. One stick will do the trick, but throw a mechanism in there for good measure.
  - 8.) Pilot Wheel - Simple here, surround a mechanism with sticks. Easy as that.
  - 9.) Barrel - You'll need this for your weaponry. Clean one stick with an iron ingot.
  - 10.) Steam Cell - A very important contraption for the engineering guild. It's a fuel cell, essentially, but for steamwork mechanisms. One water bucket, surround with coal, but the corners are iron ingots.
  - 11.) Flintlock Pistol - you know exactly what this is. Center left, Barrel, Center, mechanism, center right, flint, bottom right, stick.
  - 12.) Breechloader Rifle - Crafted with center row consisting of barrel, barrel, and explosive powder. Bottom row consisting of air, a mechanism, and a stick.
  - 13.) Matchlock Rifle - Center Row, barrel, barrel, torch. Bottom row, air, mechanism, stick.
  - For now, this concludes what I can teach you, however you may learn more in the future from others.

  - Brewin's easy. Ya just gotta work at it. Lemme give you some pointers.
  - You can make a brewin' pot by puttin a cauldron over 'n open flame. Once you fill that cauldron with water, you can throw your ingredients into the cauldron with right click.
  - As you place a certain number of each ingredient in, you're well on your way to brewin. However, something you should note - you must take out your ingredients after a certain amount of time, 
  - or else they'll get nasty. Collect by right clickin with a water bottle. Once you got your brews, you can age them by putting them in a barrel. Specific barrels can affect drinks differently, so do your research.
