  - The Rules and Regulations of the Grand Sonnarie Naval Factions
  - Ships and vessels loan a great deal of agency to those who take part in what they have to offer, however there are critical rules that must be followed to ensure order.
  - Firstly,<n>Your vessel must be of a reasonable size. Warvessels must be specifically granted by Mayor Moreau, however their lack of current need will likely impact that decision. Small and medium sized ships are acceptable.
  - Secondly,<n>When moving your vessel back to a dock, ensure that the sides of your vessel are at least three meters (blocks) away from the pier. This ensures that your ship does not become attatched to the dock, inhibiting your departure.
  - Thirdly,<n>It is a common rule to not steal other vessels. It is a sign of faith amongst individuals here to prevent lawlessness from breaking out.
  - Fouthly,<n>Be aware of the great storm. Sail close to the land, for sailing too far out to sea may take you to the edge of what is travelable, potentially destroying your vessel.
  - Fifthly,<n>When constructing your vessel, attempt to restrict your builds to planks, log highlights, fences, stairs, and single chests. Double chests will prevent the ship from moving,
  - and stairs, gates, redstone, and other abstract blocks may break off of your ship when rotating or even sailing directly. ((See the forums for acceptable blocks))
  - ((OOC Note))<n>There are many different types of Movecraft vessels that can be sailed. With this novel, you have access to the "Ship" type. This type can only be sailed on water.
  - Other shiptypes, such as elevators and airships, exist. If you are interested in sailing these, you will need to RP to get them.))
